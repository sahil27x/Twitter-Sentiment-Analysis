# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is based on the sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.

- This script can tell you the sentiments of people regarding to any events happening in the world by analyzing tweets related to that event. It will search for tweets about any topic and analyze each tweet to see how positive or negative it's emotion is.
- It can also perform user spcific sentiment analysis.
- The application performs real time sentiment analysis and plots the live trend graph.
- It also generates Realtime Positive-Negative Wordclouds.
- The Model is trained on CNN and LSTM where LSTM performed better.
- Modules used-
1. NLTK
2. Sklearn
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Keras
7. Regex
8. tweepy

- The Notebook consist of-
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning/Preprocessing
3. Using Word2vec-for text vectorization
4. Training the Neural Network
5. Evaluating Model-Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Fetching Live tweets using Twitter Api
7. Perform sentiment analysis on them using trained model
